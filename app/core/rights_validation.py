Publication Eligibility and Rights Validation Module (CIAPI-L004)

Enforces strict fail-closed publication gates:
1. Documents without explicit ELIGIBLE status and complete rights audit evidence cannot be published.
2. Rejects unknown or missing third-party permission decisions and inconsistent evidence.
3. Source-level registry fields (APPROVED, Tier 1, government status, domain) NEVER confer document clearance.
