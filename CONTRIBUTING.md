# Contributing to CancerInfo API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CancerInfo API**! Every pull request, clinical source citation check, and code contribution helps make cancer information more transparent, reliable, and accessible for everyone in the world.

## How You Can Contribute

1. **Suggest or Add New Authoritative Health Sources**:
   - We strictly aggregate from **Tier 1 (Government & Multilateral Public Health Bodies)** and **Tier 2 (Premier Accredited Cancer Centers & Societies)**.
   - We do _not_ ingest private sponsored content, unverified forums, or commercial blogs.
2. **Expand Canonical Cancer Mappings & Aliases**:
   - Add international colloquial names, abbreviations (e.g. `NSCLC`, `ALL`, `CML`), or ICD-O-3 codes in `app/ingestion/seed.py`.
3. **Enhance Taxonomy & Classification**:
   - Help refine extraction rules across our 37 standardized categories in `app/core/constants.py and app/normalization/taxonomy.py`.
4. **Develop Client SDKs & Community Templates**:
   - Build client libraries in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.

## Development Setup & Workflow

The core service is Python/FastAPI. The supported launch runtime is Python 3.11 across local development, Docker, and CI.

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Prakash-Merepala/CancerInfo-API.git
cd CancerInfo-API

# 2. Set up Python virtual environment & dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the automated test suite
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/cancerinfo-tests.db python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 4. Start local development server with auto-reload
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --reload
```

### Pre-PR Validation Commands

Before opening a pull request, ensure all CI validation gates pass locally:

1. `python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --require-hashes -r requirements.txt` — Python dependencies install cleanly from the reproducible lock.
2. `python -m pip check` — Ensure dependency graph consistency.
3. `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/cancerinfo-tests.db python -m pytest tests/ -v -ra -W default` — Run the full existing suite and meaningful regression tests for the changed behavior.
4. `python -c "from app.main import app; app.openapi()"` — OpenAPI 3.1 schema generates without error.
5. `curl -f http://localhost:3000/health` — Local server health check returns 200 OK.
6. `./scripts/validate_container.sh` — Docker container builds cleanly without baked state, boots on dynamic PORT, passes all endpoint checks, and verifies data durability across container recreation.

## Code Quality Standards

- All new endpoints must include corresponding `pytest` tests under `tests/`.
- Ensure responses pass type validation in Pydantic schemas under `app/schemas/`.
- Every added medical fact **must** include its primary source URL and organization attribution.
- Respect our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Scope and review evidence

Create a task-referenced branch from the agreed base. This documentation branch is `docs/CIAPI-001-python-core-launch`, created from main and fast-forwarded to the Python refactor. Keep it open for additional commits; do not merge without the owner’s instruction.

The archived React client is future scope. Core changes must not restore a second dataset or serving implementation. Include requirements, changed files, schema/data impact, exact tests/results and unresolved risks in each handoff. Source review, local tests, CI, image boot, database restore and marketplace acceptance are separate evidence stages.

Startup creates and seeds tables. Use a disposable database for tests and never run seed/ingestion against valuable data without an approved data procedure. Public content must pass exact-document rights and citation review. See [codebase and launch assessment](docs/CODEBASE_ATLAS.md).
