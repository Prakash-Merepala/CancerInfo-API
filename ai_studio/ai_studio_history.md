## 💜 2. The Origin Story: Why This Exists

This project was conceived in hospital waiting rooms and chemotherapy infusion suites. Within a short span, **both the creator's mother and father were diagnosed with cancer**.

In software engineering, systems demand immutability, cryptographic provenance, and single sources of truth. Yet during the fight for their parents' lives, late-night internet searches revealed:
1. Contradictory medical advice and algorithmic forum clickbait.
2. Divergent screening guidelines across borders (e.g. colorectal screening beginning at age 45 in the US vs age 50-54 in the UK and Australia) with no clear jurisdictional demarcation.
3. Paywalled academic papers filled with opaque clinical jargon.
4. Generative AI tools hallucinating treatment dosages and misattributing medical studies.

The creator made a solemn pledge: **Build the public REST API they desperately needed on those dark nights.**

### The "Zero Guesswork Guarantee"
- Every symptom, screening guideline, staging system, and treatment fact is linked to an **authoritative primary source URL**.
- Backed strictly by world-leading public health bodies:
  - **National Cancer Institute (NCI)** — United States Federal Government
  - **World Health Organization (WHO)** — United Nations International Health Agency
  - **National Health Service (NHS)** — United Kingdom
  - **Cancer Australia** — Australian Government Health Agency
  - **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** — United States
- Stored with retrieval timestamp, last verified timestamp, trust tier (Tier 1 Primary Authoritative), and legal/copyright attribution.

## 📜 3. Chronological Conversation & Development History

### Phase 1: Inception & Project Architecture Definition
- The user initiated the project with the vision of building a global, free, open-access clinical oncology API with fact-level provenance.
- Key architectural rules established:
  - Absolute transparency: citations must be granular down to the paragraph/fact level.
  - Multi-jurisdictional awareness: enable developers to compare national guidelines side-by-side (`country=US`, `country=GB`, `country=AU`, `country=GLOBAL`).
  - Strict medical disclaimer: every response header and payload must state the service is for informational/developer use and does not replace licensed medical oncologists.

### Phase 2: Relational Database Modeling & Taxonomy Standard
- Designed relational schemas with SQLAlchemy 2.0 in `app/models/`:
  - `Cancer`: Canonical cancer entities with slugs, ICD-10 codes, anatomical sites.
  - `CancerAlias`: Common synonyms, medical variants, and abbreviations (`CRC` -> Colorectal Cancer, `NSCLC` -> Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer).
  - `SourceRegistry`: Approved health bodies, trust tiers, license terms, attribution templates.
  - `SourceDocument`: Scraped/retrieved source articles, original URLs, raw content.
  - `ContentRecord`: Normalized, atomic medical facts classified under canonical categories with jurisdiction scope.
  - `ContentSourceLink`: Association mapping many-to-many citations between facts and sources.
  - `ContentVersionHistory`: Audit trail tracking every update with cryptographic SHA-256 hashes.
- Established the **37 Canonical Categories Taxonomy** standardizing all oncology knowledge sections.

### Phase 3: Python FastAPI Core Implementation
- Implemented `app/main.py` with ASGI lifespan event handler seeding SQLite/PostgreSQL on boot.
- Added comprehensive middleware:
  - Sliding-window rate limiter (120 req/minute per IP) with `X-RateLimit-*` headers.
  - `X-Request-ID` UUID tracking and `X-Response-Time-MS` profiling.
  - Compliance disclaimers: `X-Medical-Disclaimer: Informational only; not medical advice`.
  - Platform health probes: `/health`, `/api/health`, `/v1/health`.
  - Built-in documentation: Swagger UI (`/docs`), ReDoc (`/redoc`), OpenAPI 3.1 (`/openapi.json`), and Developer Landing Page (`/`).
- Created modular endpoints under `app/api/v1/endpoints/`:
  - `cancers.py`: List, detail, sections, versions, sources, and category queries.
  - `search.py`: Multi-factor search resolving acronyms, synonyms, and markdown text.
  - `sources.py`: Source registry directory and trust tier audit.
  - `categories.py`: Canonical 37-category schema catalog.
  - `countries.py`: Supported jurisdictional scopes.
  - `coverage.py`: Global transparency and verification metrics.

### Phase 4: Automated Testing Suite (28 Tests)
- Implemented 28 unit and integration tests under `tests/` with pytest:
  - `test_health.py`: Verifies uptime counters, DB probe, environment config.
  - `test_cancers.py`: Verifies canonical slugs, alias resolution (`bowel-cancer` -> `colorectal-cancer`), 404 responses, and sections.
  - `test_search.py`: Verifies acronym matching (`CRC`), multi-word queries, relevance scores.
  - `test_sources.py`: Verifies trust tiers, licenses, URLs, and active status.
  - `test_taxonomy_and_normalization.py`: Verifies 37 categories, HTML stripping, bullet point extraction.
  - `test_admin_and_pipeline.py`: Verifies ingestion idempotency and seed data.

### Phase 5: Publishing, Documentation & Cloud Deployment Guides
- Created production documentation in `docs/`:
  - `FREE_HOSTING_DEPLOYMENT.md`: Step-by-step guides for $0/mo deployment on Render, Google Cloud Run (2M free requests/month), Railway, and Fly.io.
  - `APP_IDEAS_GUIDE.md`: 5 production recipes (Screening Age Navigator, RAG Oncology Copilot, Caregiver Symptom Journal, Clinical Trials Pre-Screener, Multilingual Kiosk).
  - `VALIDATION_GUIDE.md`: QA runbook, test cURLs, header audits.
  - `GITHUB_ECOSYSTEM_STATS.md`: Public health API adoption benchmarks (4.2M RapidAPI developers, 1.8M-15M monthly calls for top health APIs).
  - `USAGE_GUIDE.md`: Multi-language code snippets (cURL, Python `requests`/`httpx`, TypeScript `fetch`).
- Authored RapidAPI Hub package:
  - `rapidapi/rapidapi-openapi.json`: OpenAPI 3.1 specification configured for 1-click import.
  - `rapidapi/postman_collection.json`: Comprehensive Postman collection with tests.
  - `rapidapi/RAPIDAPI_LISTING_GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step guide to list under 100% Free plan with zero paywalls.

### Phase 6: Interactive Explorer & Full-Stack Node Runtime Bridge
- Built the interactive developer portal inside AI Studio:
  - `server.ts`: Express server mounting API router and Vite dev middleware on port 3000.
  - `src/server/api.ts`: Full Express TypeScript router mirroring all FastAPI endpoint logic and schemas, backed by `src/data/db.json`.
  - `src/App.tsx`: Rich React 18 UI with live endpoint tester, cURL copy button, response JSON visualizer, latency counter, status code badges, header inspector, RapidAPI guide, GitHub stats, and story modal.
  - `src/services/googleDrive.ts` & `src/components/GoogleDriveSync.tsx`: Google Drive OAuth 2.0 integration allowing export of cancer query results directly to Google Drive files.

### Phase 7: Dev Server Fix, Verification & Cache Cleanups
- Fixed container script issue where `package.json` had a stale `"dev": "uvicorn ..."` command that could not run in the Node environment container. Restored `"dev": "tsx server.ts"`, fixed strict typing in `api.ts`, removed unused imports, restarted the dev server, and verified all endpoints with `curl` returning `200 OK`.
- Cleaned up temporary `.pyc` and pytest cache files.

### Phase 8: Antigravity Handoff Preparation
- Created this comprehensive handoff documentation (`ai_studio_history.md`) and structured JSON context (`ai_studio_history.json`) for seamless continuation in Antigravity.

## 🎯 9. Antigravity Handoff: Immediate Next Steps & Roadmap

When you feed this document or `ai_studio_history.json` into **Antigravity**, here is the recommended immediate execution sequence to continue developing the API:

### 1. Ingestion Scaling (from 7 Cancers to 200+ Cancers)
- Expand `app/sources/adapters/nci.py` to ingest the full **NCI PDQ® (Physician Data Query)** cancer database via XML/API feeds.
- Ingest the **WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)** monographs.
- Map all ICD-10 and ICD-11 oncology diagnostic codes into the `cancers` and `cancer_aliases` tables.

### 2. Semantic Search & Vector Embeddings
- Add hybrid search combining full-text search with vector embeddings:
  - Generate 384-dimensional embeddings (e.g. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or Gemini embeddings) for each `ContentRecord`.
  - Enable queries like *"What tests are recommended if I have bleeding after menopause?"* to semantically match `cervical-cancer/screening` and `diagnosis` even if exact keywords aren't present.

### 3. Automated Crawler & Freshness Verification Pipeline
- Build scheduled background crawlers (weekly/monthly) using `HTTP ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers.
- When an authoritative health agency updates a web page or guideline, compute the SHA-256 diff, generate a new `ContentRecord` version, and log the update in `ContentVersionHistory`.

### 4. Internationalization (i18n)
- Expand `supported_languages` in `SourceRegistry`.
- Ingest Spanish clinical guidance from NCI Instituto Nacional del Cáncer (`cancer.gov/espanol`), French from INCa (Institut National du Cancer), and international French/Spanish editions from the WHO.

### 5. Production Cloud Deployment
- Deploy the Python FastAPI container to **Google Cloud Run** using the provided `Dockerfile`.
- Connect to a managed serverless PostgreSQL instance (e.g., Neon or Cloud SQL).
- Import `rapidapi/rapidapi-openapi.json` to RapidAPI Hub under the 100% Free Community plan to make it accessible to 4.2+ million developers worldwide.

### Antigravity Prompt Template
You can copy-paste the snippet below directly into Antigravity:

```text
Hello Antigravity. I am resuming development of CancerInfo API, a free, global clinical oncology REST API with fact-level provenance dedicated to cancer patients and their families. Please read 'ai_studio_history.json' and 'ai_studio_history.md' from this repository. 

Our core architecture guarantees zero guesswork: every fact links to NCI, WHO, NHS, or Cancer Australia with source URLs and legal attributions. We have 37 standardized taxonomy categories, 28 passing pytest unit tests, an OpenAPI 3.1 specification, and an interactive full-stack explorer.

Please continue from our roadmap in Section 9: let's expand the ingestion pipeline to ingest the next 20 major cancer types and implement semantic vector search.
```
